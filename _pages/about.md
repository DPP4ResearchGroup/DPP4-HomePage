## Who we are
We are a group of researchers studying the molecular bases, evolution and clinical implications of a family of proteases, namely dipeptidyl peptidases-4 (DPP4) family.   We are based in [Flinders University](https://www.flinders.edu.au/) at [Bedford Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bedford+Park+SA+5042/@-35.0223221,138.5595712,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ab0d0856500dee9:0x5033654628ea950!8m2!3d-35.021!4d138.568), which is located just on the outskirt of the beautiful [Adelaide, Australia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adelaide+SA/@-34.9265688,138.5894568,13.94z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x6ab735c7c526b33f:0x4033654628ec640!2sAdelaide+SA!3b1!8m2!3d-34.9284989!4d138.6007456!3m4!1s0x6ab735c7c526b33f:0x4033654628ec640!8m2!3d-34.9284989!4d138.6007456).  

## What the hack is Dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 (DPP4) family 
DPP4 family is a sub-family of serine proteases, three of its members (DPP4, DPP8 and DPP9) possess a rare ability to hydrolysis the peptides after penultimate proline. This hydrolytic potency enables DPP4 family proteases to regulate some important biological molecules including but not limited to metabolic hormones and a broad spectrum of cytokines [^1]. In addition, DPP4 family proteases also known to function as antigens on various cell surface. Consequently, DPP4 family have profound implications in cellular homeostasis regulations and various cancer development. [^2]
