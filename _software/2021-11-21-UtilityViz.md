The storage stake is one significant piece of infrastructure in modern business operations. The cost associated with managing exploding data volume can not be underestimated in modern increasing data-driven decision models.

Here, we present an R package that enables future utilization modelling based on historical time-series data and further support the evidence-based procurement decision making process by simulating financial outcomes on various procurement strategies. In addition, the proposed workflow is further supported by visualizations and an easy-to-use dashboard framework. More detail please visit [UtilityViz home page]().
